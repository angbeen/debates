The ceremony, which took place at the corner of Old Dixie Highway and West Blue Heron Boulevard, was a step away from the past and a look to the future.\n\nA sign replacing Old Dixie Highway that connected that road to Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. had already been taken down the day before, on Wednesday, Dec. 16, at 5 p.m. Masters and other members of the commission present on Dec. 17 gave the sign they took down on Wednesday to Johnson. The other sign, taken down on Thursday, would go in the city’s archives as a remembrance of the city’s history.  The city of Riviera Beach Council approved the name change in August 2015. The approval passed with one Councilmember opposed, Councilwoman Dawn Prado.  When Mayor Masters spoke on Thursday, he said that the process to rename the street was one that took several years, though he had wanted to rename the street years ago. Masters also noted that in the past, Blacks could not cross Old Dixie Highway, and there was a dividing line between Old Dixie Highway between whites and Blacks. Masters said that the city would move into the future and that they would bury the racist history of Old Dixie Highway, and move into a place where whites, blacks and members of all races would become one. The election of President Barack Obama was a key moment in the country’s history, he said, in that all people of all races had voted for his election and re-election.\n","link_source":"http://miamitimesonline.com/news/2015/dec/23/confederate-street-name-removed-city/","finalized":"Yes","confederate_type":"Street/Road/Highway","article_date":"12/23/2015","headline":"Confederate street name removed from city","year_established":"","city_county":"Palm Beach County","state":"FL","cartodb_georef_status":false,"column_1461190443860":null,"column_1461190480171":null}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.37924,28.53834]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":22,"in_process":false,"private":null,"summary":"Students, parents, alumni and other community members will weigh in about whether to change the name of College Park's Lee Middle, which is named for Confederate leader Robert E.
